      <h3>A non-tech discussion on problem solving.</h3>
      <p class = "answer">
          One of the ways you can work when you are writing code, is to write some tests that your code has to pass, and then see if the code passes the tests. You can think of it like a cooking recipe. If you write the recipe and ask someone to follow all the steps carefully, you expect certain outcomes. These outcomes can be multiple, you might expect the recipe to make 12 cookies, you might expect them to be chewy and delicious, to be of a particular color etc. If any outcome isn't respected, you have to asssume that the recipe has a flaw.

        So I was working in this particular model, and I couldn't make my code pass the tests. I ended up spending some time looking at my code and making sure that I understood what each piece of code, each variable, each word, bracket, coma etc was supposed to do and mean. And I still couldn't make it work. I felt like the piece of the puzzle I was missing, was the understanding of what my code (recipe) was exactly supposed to do. So I went in and spent some time looking at the tests that my code was supposed to pass. It helped and I made some progress but I was still stuck trying to pass the last of the tests. So finally I went and looked at the solution. It looked confusing, and once again, I broke it down into parts, trying to understand what each piece of code meant and what each of them was doing.

      <p class = "answer">
        In the end, what helped me most was to copy and paste the solution, and play around changing the name of the variables, changing the layout of the code, so I could wrap my name around what did what, what got broken when I changed a certain bit. When you have some code that works but doesn't give you the outcome you expected (you get delicious cookies, but only 10 instead of 12), you can get the code to show you the outcome, and that can give you clues as to what is wrong (you converted the recipe to metric with a mistake for example and you don't have as much dough as expected). Those clues help you look in the right place for the mistake in the code.

        Once I had done all those things, I was still a bit confused so I asked my partner (who has been working in JavaScript for years), to help me understand more clearly what was going on. It was really helpful to be able to discuss it and by the end I felt confident that I understood how and why the code worked.

        So I used the rubber ducky method of problem solving, explaining to myself in a simple way what wasn't working and what each piece of code was meant to do. I also used console.logging, asking someone for help and breaking the problem down into smaller pieces. Oh and Google, a lot of Googling.
      </p>
      <p class = "answer">
        I feel confident using these techniques and they come pretty naturally to me.
