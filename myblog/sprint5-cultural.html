        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <p class = "answer">
          I learned that I have to careful with my ego, I easlily get overly confident when people give me compliments. This course has so far been easier than I was expecting and I am not sure what to think. Either I was fooling myself with how hard it was going to be, people have been repeating so much that it was going to be hard!! Like when you go see a movie and someone told you it was amazing, you might have still enjoyed it but your expectations changed your feelings in the end. I was so prepared for this course to be overwhelming that now I'm not sure what to believe anymore. Either it suits how my brain works or I was building it up too much...
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h3>
        <p class = "answer">
          Not so much. i come from a background where I have learned and used all these core strengths. In my previous degree, we did a lot of critical reflection and learning how to learn.
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h3>
        <p class = "answer">
          Again, since I was already familiar with the material, it wasn't too bad. The values and identities part did take me a while to get through and a lot of reflection.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </h3>
        <p class = "answer">
          I understand those skills are extremely important in order to be able to work in a team and learn efficiently, no matter what your area of expertise. Being able to work with people and undersatnd them is essential to working together.
        </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3>
        <p class = "answer">
          I didn't feel like the core stuff took too much time and it was nice to go over this type of material again.
