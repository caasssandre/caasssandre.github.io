        <li>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</li>
        <span class ="answer">The margin, the border and the padding are the things that surround an element. The padding fits directly around the element and is found within the border, it can be of a color chosen using background-color. The border is more of a physical barrier, and it can be made visible, it is around the padding. The margin is the white space that surrounds the element, outside of the border and it creates space between different elements.</span>
        <li>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</li>
        <span class ="answer">Ids are used for specific elements that are not repeated throughout the page. You can only use the id on one element. If an element needs a selector and that selector might be needed again, then using the class is necessary.</span>
        <li>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</li>
        <span class ="answer">Relative positionning moves the element relatively to its old position, without affecting the rest of the elements on the page. Absolute positioning is when an element is positioned in relation to it's nearest parent element. If that element is moved, the absolute positionned element will move with it. Fixed positioning stops an element moving when scrolling. It keeps its position relative to the viewport.</span>
        <li>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</li>
        <span class ="answer">Display inline fits the span container around the element whereas display inline-block creates a rectangular block of a size that can be determined in the css code.</span>
