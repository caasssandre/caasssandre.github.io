      <h3>Research Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <h4>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h4>
      <p class = "answer">
        The process of learning is codependent with the process of changing and modifying the way our brain functions. When a student meets a problem that is proving difficult, it is hard for her to persevere with the learning if she does not believe that her brain has the ability to change and adapt. The student may feel like the task at hand is insurmountable and give up, run away from the difficulty and in doing so, defeat the purpose of the learning process. The knowledge that brains possess the power to change and grow empowers the student to keep pushing even when things get hard, knowing that the difficulty of the exercise itself provides learning, independently of the achievement of a correct answer.
      </p>
      <h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h4>
      <p class = "answer">
          As a student myself, I will focus on the learning process rather than the goal of a correct answer. Focus on the journey, it will take me to the desired destination in time. To further the metaphor, I will remember that each task and learning opportunity is one more step towards the next hut, until all the days take me to my destination. There may be storms, I may get lost, have to camp in the rain but if I keep moving forward and equip myself with the right tools I will succeed in reaching my destination.
      </p>
      <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h4>
      <p class = "answer">
          To increase my neuroplasticity, I will have to practice, and repeat tasks and exercises. I will also use the current brain pathways that I possess and that are strong, such as putting my current learning into context. The third thing that I can do to improve my neuroplasticity is to understand neuroplasticity itself and trust that my brain is actually building and strengthening pathways, even on days when it feels like progress is slow or nonexistent. Also journalling!!

      <h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>
      <h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h4>
      <p class = "answer">
          Growth mindset is the belief that a student has that they can in fact learn and that they have the ability to grow. It is relevant because without that belief, it is hard to stay motivated and keep learning.
      </p>
      <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
      <p class = "answer">
          I was familiar with the concept of neutoplasticity therefore I did not learn anything new in that chapter. However, I was surprised to hear the extent of the effects of the growth mindset on children in schools, I did not expect that effect to be so great.
      </p>
      <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
      <p class = "answer">
          As said above, I intend to integrate the growth mindset in my journey to increase my resilience to difficulty and failure. I will also share this growth mindset around me, being more aware of how I address people when commenting on their achievements and abilities in order to create a culture of growth, beneficial for all.
