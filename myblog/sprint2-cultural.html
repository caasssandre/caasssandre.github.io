            <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
            <p class= "answer">
                My long term goal is to be able to have a career that I enjoy and that allows me flexibility. I would like to be able to have a diversity of skills and work on a range of intersting projects. I also love the idea of having a skillset that is in demand worldwide, allowing me to travel and live in different countries if I want to.
            </p>
            <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
            <p class= "answer">
                I would like to become better at sharing my knowlegde and skill. I have noticed that I am pretty poor at teaching people what I know.
            </p>
            <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
            <p class= "answer">
                I think I am a good communicator and a good learner, but I know that I am pretty poor at using my skills to the fullest I can sometimes rely on what is easy and not push myself to try hard. I belive that my listening skills could also be improved.
            </p>
            <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
            <p class= "answer">
                I will manage my workload by structuring my day in a way that works for me. I will do a few hours of solid work and then take a good break, eat some food and do some exercise before I spend another few hours working hard. I will also focus on being open to criticism and listen to what my colleagues and members of my team have to say. Take in suggestions with an open mind.
            </p>
            <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
            <p class= "answer">
                When I encounter a difficulty with the learning, I will first make sure that I spend some time and effort to find a solution before jumping in and asking for help. Then I will try to seek help from my cohort, listening to their suggestions and brainstroming ideas. The next step would be to ask a member of EDA staff for help and if we are still stuck, as the wider community, on stackoverflow for example.
            </p>
            <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
            <p class= "answer">
                I expect the facilitation team to help me progress in my learning and get unstuck. Also to point out things that I might be able to do better, and offer constructive criticism.
            </p>
            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
            <p class= "answer">
                I am flexible with my availabilities but currently mostly busy on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays.
            </p>
            <h3>For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h3>
            <p class= "answer">
                Nope.
