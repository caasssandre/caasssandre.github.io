        <ul>
            <li>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</li>
            <span class= "answer">My long term goal is to be able to have a career that I enjoy and that allows me flexibility. I would like to be able to have a diversity of skills and work on a range of intersting projects. I also love the idea of having a skillset that is in demand worldwide, allowing me to travel and live in different countries if I want to.</span>
            <li>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</li>
            <span class= "answer">I would like to become better at sharing my knowlegde and skill. I have noticed that I am pretty poor at teaching people what I know.</span>
            <li>A description of your own strengths and limitations</li>
            <span class= "answer">I think I am a good communicator and a good learner, but I know that I am pretty poor at using my skills to the fullest I can sometimes rely on what is easy and not push myself to try hard. I belive that my listening skills could also be improved.</span>
            <li>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</li>
            <span class= "answer">I will manage my workload by structuring my day in a way that works for me. I will do a few hours of solid work and then take a good break, eat some food and do some exercise before I spend another few hours working hard. I will also focus on being open to criticism and listen to what my colleagues and members of my team have to say. Take in suggestions with an open mind.</span>
            <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</li>
            <span class= "answer">When I encounter a difficulty with the learning, I will first make sure that I spend some time and effort to find a solution before jumping in and asking for help. Then I will try to seek help from my cohort, listening to their suggestions and brainstroming ideas. The next step would be to ask a member of EDA staff for help and if we are still stuck, as the wider community, on stackoverflow for example.</span>
            <li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
            <span class= "answer">I expect the facilitation team to help me progress in my learning and get unstuck. Also to point out things that I might be able to do better, and offer constructive criticism.</span>
            <li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</li>
            <span class= "answer">I am flexible with my availabilities but currently mostly busy on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays.</span>
            <li>For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</li>
            <span class= "answer">Nope.</span>
