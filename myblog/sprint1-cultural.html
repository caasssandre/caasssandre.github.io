            <li>Gather evidence to identify what your personal values are. The reflection gets you to examine and identify who you are at this point, this involves a self-evaluation and seeking feedback from two or three trusted friends, family, whanau, colleagues. This allows you to compare how you see yourself, with how others see you. Evidence might include: stories of how these values were demonstrated in practice; a testimonial/feedback from someone; an achievement you are proud of; using a tool to help you surface and name the values most important to you; visuals or narratives that help you describe where your values came from; whakatauki or quotes that sum up your values; your review of learning.</li>
            <span class="answer">After much reflection and chat with friends, I have identified values that are important to me, however, I have a feeling that as I continue along this journey, I might discover more about myself and review this article. I have identified that, amongst other things, I believe in integrity, determination and equality.</span>
            <span class="answer">Integrity is important to me because without it, we would live in a world with poor morals, where each and everyone could behave according to self-interest and forgo ethical decisions. With integrity, we live by a set of rules and morals that we have crafted for ourselves and we make decisions according to these rules. I try to respect my value of integrity which also involves staying true to my other values of determination and equality. I endeavour to speak up when I see injustice and act in a way that hopefully will bring more equality to the world.</span>
            <span class="answer">Determination to me is a value that matters because without it, nothing meaningless ever happens. It is difficult to achieve important things and you have to allow time and effort to achieve them. I am working on my determination, a good example I guess was when I decided to cycle across France and Italy by myself. It was a lot easier than a lot of things that most people have to do in their lives but I am a work in progress, and I achieved that little goal of mine. I cycled the kilometres, and it wasn't easy everyday but I reached my destination. And in the process, I learned about myself. I am happy about that.</span>
            <span class="answer">Equality is a difficult value to live by. I see myself as privileged, I never missed a meal in my life, I had the freedom and means to travel and move to a country across the world, I went to university without having to worry about how to pay my student fees... I am aware that all these things aren't given to everyone, actually, in the world, these opportunities are only available to a few lucky people. So respecting a value of equality is difficult when the world is such an unfair place. So I try, I donate to charities I believe in and vote for the political parties that value equality. But it is not enough. And to be fair, it feels overwhelming and impossible to achieve the utopia of equality. So I do the little things in the hope that in the end, it will make a difference.</span>
            <span class="answer">When I asked my friends about my values, they talked to me about how I care for the environment, for social justice and feminism, and how I am an adventurer, always undertaking new things. It fits with how I view myself but I know that I am also sometimes selfish, doing things for my own enjoyment even when I know that those are not the best choices for the greater good. We all need to work on ourselves and this exercise of reflection is a good opportunity to appreciate the good and the bad of our behaviours and how we can change for the better.</span>
            <span class="answer">My culture is an inherent part of my values. It is often something that I think about, how lucky I was to be raised in an environment where I was taught values of respect and equality. Had I been raised in an environment where greed and xenophobia were the rule, would I have found it in myself to break out of my culture? I don't know...</span>
            <li>Gather evidence to identify your strengths and areas for development. Evidence might include: personality or skills/capability assessment tools like Myers Briggs, Strengthsfinder; DOPE; Capability Sort; Minded; task 1 examples.</li>
            <span class="answer">Strengths:<ul><li>Ease of learning.</li><li>Core skills from my professional experience, such as communication and problem solving.</li><li>Good at working in a group.</li><li>Extraverted.</li></ul></span>
            <span class="answer">Areas for development.<ul><li>I will learn to focus on how I can improve my performance with hard work and dedication rather than being satisfied with the ease of getting "good enough".</li><li>I will learn to be more focused while I work, finding tools to avoid distractions and mindfulness to be present in the moment.</li><li>I will learn to better organise my day in order to be more productive and avoid wasting time. To further the above mention, I will plan my approach to better avoid procrastination.</li></ul></span>
