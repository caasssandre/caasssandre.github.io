            <li>What is Emotional Intelligence?</li>
            <span class= "answer">Emotional inteligence refers to the ability people have to recognise feelings, be it their own or others', and know how to act in a manner that respects those feelings, intelligently and with empathy. It enables us to function as a society, to avoid conflict and promotes growth, both of the group and the individual. It is important in a group working environment, to work efficiently and allow each member of the team to progress.</span>
            <li>How is it different to IQ?</li>
            <span class= "answer">IQ refers to our ability to understant and develop logical thinking. It differs from EQ in the fact that it only involves the individual's mental capabilities, not in relation with others and relationships but when faced with complex tasks. Both are necessary for success but it has been shown that in the high leadership roles, the importance of EQ outweighs the importance of IQ.</span>
            <li>Why is it important?</li>
            <span class= "answer">It is important to possess a good EQ, and to work to improve our EQ in order to function well as a team member. To use an example, let's talk about climate change. There are a lot of great minds out there with great ideas and solutions to avoid environmental collapse. However, each of these great ideas, on their own, cannot change the current downward path humanity is on. If we imagine each country is just one person, we realise that each person is stuck in their desires for personal growth. We would need each of those people (countries) to improve their EQ in order to work together and resolve the problem. IQ alone cannot do it.</span>
