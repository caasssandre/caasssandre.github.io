          <li>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</li>
          <span class = "answer">HTML is the builder of the website. If you were playing with lego, you coulod imagine that the HTML decides wich legos you get, and put them in various containers. CSS decides the size of the legos and the color, and also the shape of the containers and where they are placed in relation to one another.</span>
          <li>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</li>
          <span class = "answer">Let's use the example of a cookie recipe. Control flow is the recipe that tells the chef (the computer) the order in which to execute each step. 1. Put all dry ingredients in a bowl 2. Wisk eggs and sugar together 3. Icorporate wet ingredients to dry ingredients 4. With your hands, take a small amount of dough, roll it into a ball and place it on baking sheet. Repeat this until the dough is all used up 5. Place the cookies in the oven for 20 minutes. Now, let's talk about step 4. Step 4 is a classic example of a loop, it asks the chef to do an action once (roll dough into ball) return something (place cookie onto sheet) and repeat the action. It also tells you when to stop. It might seem obvious to stop when the dough runs out, but when we are writing code, if we do not tell the computer when to stop, it is likely to crash. Here we go, delicious cookies and an explanation of control flow and loops :)</span>
          <li>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</li>
          <span class = "answer">The DOM or Document Object Model is an interface that allows the user to modify any object using JavaScript. It allows to create a responsive interactive website where user actions (clicks, hovers etc) can create rapid change without having to go back to the server side of the website. It uses the idea of nodes, where a node is an element or a piece of an element that can be extracted and modified.</span>
          <li>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</li>
          <span class = "answer">Arrays are ordered and objects are unordered. This dictates the way that data is accessed. For arrays, data can be accessed using an index system, where the first piece of data in the array has index [0], the second has index [1] etc. Those indexes can be put one after another if dealing with arrays of arrays. Multiple arrays can be nested within one another. Objects contain an unordered list of data pairs, a property and a value. The value can be any element type. In order to access data from an object, we need to use the name of the property, either in bracket form like this: object[prop], or using the dot syntax like this: object.prop. There are also functions that can help us find information about an object such as oject.hasOwnProperty(prop) which tells us wether the property exists within that object.</span>
          <li>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</li>
          <span class = "answer">Functions are a tool used to describe a code action step by step. They are useful because they allow us to manipulate objects and data, to make things happen. They are also useful in the way they can be named and reused. If we need to perform the same action in multiple different situations, we only need to call the function again. Some functions exist within the programming language and can be used at any point, other more specific functions need to be written out and named to be reused.</span>
